Home Exercise – Full Stack

Background
Hey there! Welcome to your first step towards being part of Pierate’s initial team!
If you’re reading this, you’re probably interested in the Full Stack Developer position,
so we’ve prepared a home assignment to have a first assessment of your capabilities.
Because our team is still very small, it’s important for everyone to be independent
and be able to learn whatever is required, so this exercise will require to do a bit
of everything.

This exercise will ensure you are capable in the following:
React
Node.js
Relational DBs
Basic UI/UX sense

Assignment

Using react, node.js and some relational database of your choice,
you are required to develop a
UI for admins. You’ll have to develop 3 pages:
1. Admin login page
2. Admin - Users’ management page
a. Manage a user’s permissions
b. Reset its password
c. Browse the Users page (described in next bullet) as some selected user
3. Users page, where he can do one OR MORE of the following, based on his permissions:
a. Manage a to-do list
b. Save contacts (name and phone number is enough, no need to edit)
c. Manage a pros/cons table

UI/UX-wise, you’re free to implement the pages as you like,
but keep in mind that it should make sense and be intuitive for the user.

Bonus:
1. For the DB, if you decide to use a docker, please submit a file with
the docker command to run the DB container (don’t forget to expose the ports).
2. If you want to containerize the whole app, we won’t object

Submission
Either .zip file or a link to a Git repository.

Submission must include:
 Codebase
 Some textual explanation of which DB was used
 DDLs of all tables in the DB

As explained in the previous part, you can also containerize the whole app. If you do so, please
provide us with a link to the image, and make sure it’s public.
Note that the assignment will be graded on code design, DB design and how intuitive the pages
are.
Good Luck!
